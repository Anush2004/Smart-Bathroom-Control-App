### Created as a part of IoT course final project - Team Members: Anush, Mukta, Ronak, Sriya

- *Playbook*: Android App code

#### Brief Description of the project:
Note: Refer to the smart-bathroom repo for more details. This is just the app code.
The main goal of the project is to create a Smart Bathroom environment where the user is a button away from controlling the lights, doors, flush, and the seat movements.
The app was created using the help of MIT App Inventor's codebase and allows for a simple UI interface design. Arduino code (not shown) was integrated along with this app to demonstrate a proper IoT environment.

All this was tested on a prototype model with appropriate sensors like ultrasonic sensor, water level sensor, and ESP32.
